The deliverables for this project are:

*	Create a Horizontal Bar Chart.
* 	Create a Bubble Chart.
*	Create a Gauge Chart.

## Software
JavaScript, HTML and Plotly. 

## Results 

### Create a Horizontal Bar Chart.

The bar chart shows the top ten bacteria culture found on the subjected select, beside the bar chart one can find the demographic information such as volunteer ID, age, ethnicity and weekly washing frequency.

The bar also has information on the species name for each bacterial ID number. When the user hovers the mouse over the bar, the description of id numbers of the bacteria found will be displayed.

### Create a Bubble Chart.

The below bacteria bubble chart represents the combination of Operational Taxonomic Unit (out_ids) which means the bacterial type combined with the species name for each bacterial Id number.

### Create a Gauge Chart.

The gauge chart represents the weekly washing frequency per volunteer within a range of 0 – 10.
